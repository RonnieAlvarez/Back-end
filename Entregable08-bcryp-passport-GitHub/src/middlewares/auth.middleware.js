/**
 * This is an authentication middleware function that checks if a user is logged in and returns their
 * name and roll if they are, otherwise it redirects them to the login page with a 401 status code.
 * @param req - The request object represents the HTTP request that the client (usually a web browser)
 * sends to the server.
 * @param res - res stands for response and it is an object that represents the HTTP response that an
 * Express app sends when it receives an HTTP request. It contains methods for sending the response
 * back to the client, such as res.send(), res.json(), res.redirect(), etc.
 * @param next - `next` is a callback function that is called when the middleware function is done
 * processing the request. It is used to pass control to the next middleware function in the chain. If
 * an error occurs, the error should be passed as the first argument to `next`. If there are no errors,
